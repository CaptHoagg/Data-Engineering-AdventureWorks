## Data Engineering

Our data engineering efforts encompassed the following:

![Overall Architecture](Images/OverallArchitecture.png)

1. **Data Source Layer:** 
   - We utilized the AdventureWorks 2019 database as our primary data source, hosted on Azure SQL Server.

2. **Data Ingestion Layer:** 
   - We employed Azure Data Factory to extract data from the AdventureWorks2019 database. This data was then ingested into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, stored as parquet files.

3. **Data Storage Layer:** 
   - The data was organized into three tiers within Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2:
     - **Bronze:** Raw data
     - **Silver:** Pre-processed data
     - **Gold:** Enriched and refined data ready for analytics

4. **Data Process Layer:** 
   - The processed data in the Gold layer was loaded into Azure Synapse Serverless SQL Pool 

5. **Consumption Layer:** 
   - Data from  Azure Synapse Serverless SQL Pool is integrated into Power BI for detailed analysis and visualization.
   - We built a data model consisting of Fact, Dimension, and Bridge tables to facilitate efficient data analysis.

## Dashboards Built

We developed several interactive dashboards in Power BI to provide insights into different aspects of AWC’s operations:

### Overview Dashboard
The Overview Dashboard provides a high-level summary of the company’s overall performance, focusing on key metrics related to product inventory management, sales, purchasing, manufacturing, and product lifecycle.

- **Overview Page:** Summarizes critical KPIs and serves as a navigation hub for detailed analysis.
